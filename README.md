# 🌙 Arch Linux Rice – Hyprland Setup

A minimal and aesthetic Arch Linux setup with Hyprland, Waybar, Eww, and Fish shell. Perfect for a clean workflow and customizable environment.
The snipping tools and stuff was made by my friend and not owned by me. Alot of files might actually be of no use so yeah.
